# Rigatoni alla Vodka

## Servings: 4-6

## Time to prepare: 30 Minutes

## Ingredients:
1 lb dried rigatoni
Kosher salt
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tbsp olive oil
1 large shallot
Red pepper flakes
3 garlic cloves
1/2 cup vodka
1/2 cup tomato paste
Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 to 1 cup heavy cream
Grated parmesan

## Equipment needed:
Large pot
Strainer
Measuring Cups
Measuring Spoons
Bowls for serving

## Steps for preparation:
1. Cook pasta al dente, about 1 minute shy of doneness. Scoop out 1 1/2 cups of pasta water and set aside. Drain pasta.
2. In your empty pasta pot, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add shallots, garlic, and pepper flakes (1/2 teaspoon for a moderate kick), and cook until shallots are softened but not brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. 
3. Add vodka and cook, stirring up anything stuck, until vodka disappears. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 3 to 4 minutes, until the tomato paste is one shade darker. 
4. Add 1 cup of the reserved pasta water, scraping up any stuck tomato paste, stirring until the mixture becomes a sauce. Season it now — I add just about 2 teaspoons kosher salt and many grinds of black pepper — simmer for 2 minutes. 
5. Add cream; I begin with 1/2 cup and then add more, a splash at a time, until I get the shade of orange/pink that I am craving.
6. Add drained pasta to sauce and toss to coat and adding last 1/2 cup of reserved pasta water, a splash at a time, as needed to loosen the sauce. Cook pasta and sauce together for 1 minute.
7. Sprinkle with basil and scoop into bowls, garnishing each with parmesan or pecorino and extra red pepper flakes, to taste. Eat immediately.
